ðŸŽ§ Visualizing My Spotify Listening Habits with Python ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“Š
In this project, we delve into the analysis of my Spotify listening habits using Python. By leveraging data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, we can gain insights into various aspects of my music consumption, including the platforms I use, the duration of tracks I listen to, and my preferences for different artists and genres.

Objectives:
Understand Listening Patterns: Analyze how much time I spend listening to music across different platforms and identify trends in my listening habits.
Explore Track Data: Investigate the characteristics of the tracks I listen to, including the average duration, the frequency of skips, and the most played tracks.
Visualize Data: Create clear and informative visualizations to represent my listening habits, making it easier to interpret the data and draw conclusions.

Data Overview:
The dataset includes various features related to my Spotify listening habits, such as:

spotify_track_uri: Unique identifier for each track.
ts: Timestamp of when the track was played.
platform: The platform used to listen to the track (e.g., mobile, desktop).
ms_played: Duration of the track played in milliseconds.
track_name: Name of the track.
artist_name: Name of the artist.
album_name: Name of the album.
reason_start: Reason for starting the track.
reason_end: Reason for ending the track.
shuffle: Indicates whether the track was played in shuffle mode.
skipped: Indicates whether the track was skipped (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
Key Visualizations:
Distribution of Listening Time: A histogram showing the distribution of ms_played to understand how long I typically listen to tracks.
Platform Usage: A pie chart illustrating the percentage of listening time across different platforms, highlighting my preferred way to consume music.
Track Popularity: A bar plot displaying the top 10 most played tracks, providing insight into my favorite songs.
Skipped Tracks Analysis: A count plot showing the number of tracks skipped versus not skipped across different platforms, helping to identify patterns in my listening behavior.
Correlation Analysis: A heatmap visualizing the correlation between different numerical features, such as ms_played and skipped, to uncover relationships in my listening habits.
Conclusion:
By visualizing my Spotify listening habits, I can better understand my music preferences and consumption patterns. This analysis not only provides insights into my listening behavior but also serves as a foundation for further exploration, such as identifying trends over time or comparing my habits with those of others.

Tools and Libraries Used:
Python: The primary programming language for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Seaborn: For making statistical graphics more attractive and informative.
This project showcases the power of data visualization in understanding personal habits and preferences, making it a fun and insightful exploration of my Spotify listening experience!
